# Readâ€™O Verse !

Our website, Read'O Verse, was designed with the goal of addressing the needs of book readers worldwide. From students preparing for competitive exams to individuals who simply enjoy reading, our platform offers an opportunity to rent books rather than purchasing them outright. This is particularly helpful for students who only need a particular chapter from a specific book, as they can now rent it from someone else in the same city at a nominal cost.

Additionally, our platform offers users a personal library feature (My Space) where they can store all their eBooks and audiobooks in one location, complete with a to-do list feature and graphical analysis of all tasks (currently still in development). Furthermore, users can stay up-to-date on literary events and book fairs taking place in their city. With a single tap, users can access information about all nearby libraries, and they can even enjoy soothing music while reading based on their preferences.

All of these features make Read'O Verse an exceptional platform for avid readers, and we are proud to offer such a comprehensive service to our users.

## How we built it?

Our web application was developed utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the popular CSS framework, Tailwind CSS. Our team began by creating a login page and a profile viewing interface. Subsequently, we integrated additional features, including events listings, a reading zone, a buy/rent functionality, one-tap search, and a personalized "My Space" section. These features were added in stages as part of our commitment to providing an optimal user experience for our audience.
